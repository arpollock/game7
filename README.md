#### Why We Deserve 100 Points ####

	We deserve 100 points becasue we successfully made an exciting and addictive game using HTML5 CSS3 and Javascript. We used a visually appealing color layout, a simple to comprehend page layout and provided all necessary information to the player.

#### CSS3 Features Used ####

	We used an image boarder aroung the game window (with the mines logo) and gave the gameplay area a fixed size on the screen, as to avoud weird sizing on the character and the obstacles. 

	We stlyed the webpage to use similar colors as seen on mines webpages since we used the mines logo as a border and the infamous "Paone Power-Up".

	Also, We used text shadowing on the title with an apropriate color in proportion to the web page.

	We also change the colors on the page whenever a Paone Power-Up is activated within our JS file.

## JavaScript Libraries ##

	We used jQuery and the advised HighScoreAPI in conjunction with basic JS.

## JavaScript Difficulties ##

	We had difficulty detecting a collision with an obstacle. Since obstacles and character images are drawn from point (0,0), we had to identify the size of the boxes and the size of the sprite and determine what would constitute as a collision based off of those calculations. 

	More difficulty arose using the animated sprite, which allowed for us to have a more visually appealing game at the cost of ease of implementation. The sprite was difficult to animate because we had to make the animation happen at a rate proportional to the game. 

	Lastly, we had to figure out how to make the ducking animation fluid with our character, so we had to delay our animation time as to not simply reprint the character whenever the duck action is performed.
